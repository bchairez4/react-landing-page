# react-web-app

Created by Brian Chairez

This project utilizes React, an open source front-end JavaScript library, to build a web application using Vite as a build tool. 
React is known for being able to create reusable components that can be used in various parts of the application. 

The purpose of this project is to create a social media clone, in this case, to recreate the Twitter Home page. 
For now, data is hardcoded to emulate retreiving data from a database.
