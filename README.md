# react-web-app

Created by Brian Chairez 

This project utilizes React, an open source front-end JavaScript library, to build a web application using Vite as a build tool. 
React is known for being able to create reusable components that can be used and or reused in various parts of the application.  

The purpose of this project is to create a social media clone, in this case, to recreate the Twitter Home page. 
Twitter has since rebranded to X, however, the underlying user interface remained about the same. 
The data used is hardcoded to simulate retrieving said data from a database.
